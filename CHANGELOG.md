# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and once there is a release this project
will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Pre-1.0: `main` is the only supported version and the wire contract is additive-only within `v1`.
The full reasoning behind any entry lives in the commit message; this file is the index.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Repository documentation set** — README with screenshots, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue and pull-request templates, and this changelog. No code changed.
- **Per-feed settings**, behind a gear on each sidebar row — hidden until hover or keyboard focus,
  always visible below 900px. Grouped by *who a setting belongs to*: yours (name override, ranked
  feed, mute, offline depth, tags), shared (feed URL, site URL, poll interval — polled once for the
  whole server, so the heading says how many other people are affected), health (last fetch, last
  success, next fetch, items held, and the publisher's own error string verbatim), and actions.
  `fetch_interval_s` is clamped at the write to 5 minutes–1 week, and `next_fetch_at` recomputes from
  the *last* fetch, so lengthening an interval cannot postpone an overdue poll.
- **A glyph vocabulary.** Left of a label means what a thing *is* — the same glyph for a destination
  everywhere it appears, so the sidebar, the palette and the tab bar teach one vocabulary rather than
  three. Right is reserved for what will *happen*, and currently holds exactly one mark: the arrow on
  a link that leaves for another site.
- **Tier 8b in `TODO.md`** — backfills the twenty-four features that were built from using the
  reader rather than from the spec. An untracked feature is one nobody can decide to remove.

### Changed

- **Scrolling the item list no longer janks.** Flicking with a reading stream open measured p95
  49.9ms, fourteen dropped frames and two 66ms long tasks: `html.RawHTML` sanitises *and* parses
  markup into nodes, and scrolling the list re-rendered the component owning the stream, so a single
  scroll frame did thirty-nine full HTML parses. Bodies are now cached by item id, the palette is
  assembled only while open, the favicon-host map is built when feeds change rather than per frame,
  and the two stream-edge checks are id comparisons instead of linear scans of 3,621 items.
  **p95 49.9ms → 16.7ms, drops 14/152 → 2/154, long tasks 2 → 0.**
- **`-allow-private` is a narrower deny list, not an off switch.** It previously disabled the SSRF
  guard outright, and since the dev server sets it automatically on a loopback bind, the most
  commonly-run configuration had no SSRF protection at all. RFC1918 and loopback are now reachable;
  link-local and the cloud metadata endpoint never are.
- **`TODO.md` audited against the code.** Thirty-seven items ticked with evidence, fourteen left open
  but annotated with precisely what part exists. A checklist that says nothing about its half-built
  items is worse than one that admits them.

### Fixed

- **Clicking inside a dialog no longer closes it.** The delegated listener resolves a click to the
  nearest ancestor carrying `data-action`; with none on the dialog, every click inside walked up to
  the backdrop and hit its close action, so touching a text field shut the panel. Affected the feed
  panel, the command palette and the help sheet.
- **Feeds can be renamed from a button**, not only by pressing Enter. A text field whose sole commit
  is an unadvertised keystroke looks broken.
- **Per-source hues render.** `html.Props{Style: …}` cannot set CSS custom properties — GWC's adapter
  assigns JS properties, and that path does not reach `--vars`, so everything rendered grey. Fixed by
  passing a style *string* through `Raw`, which takes the `setAttribute` path.
- **Search-on-Enter fires.** A `func(string)` event handler receives `event.target.value` rather than
  the key, so the handler never matched.

## 2026-07-26 — the vertical slice (untagged)

The vertical slice: storage → ingestion → service → gRPC-over-tunnel → wasm client, running against
151 subscriptions and 3,621 real items.

### Added

- **Reading.** Three-pane desktop collapsing at 1220px and 900px to a single column with a
  persistent tab bar. The article pane is a continuous stream — reaching the bottom appends the next
  piece, scrolling up prepends the previous one with the scroll position held, and nothing is ever
  taken away from under the reader. Scrolling through an article marks it read.
- **The list**, virtualised at a fixed 96px row and sized to the scope's true total rather than to
  what has been fetched, so the scrollbar is honest from the first paint and dragging into unloaded
  territory fills toward you.
- **Signals** — like/dislike verdicts, read-later, notes, per-feed tags, mark-unread. The negative
  half is the point: it is the signal ranking needs and there was nowhere to put it.
- **Listening** — the browser's own synthesiser, free and offline, plus an opt-in Smart+ voice behind
  a host allowlist and a per-user switch that defaults to off.
- **Keyboard** — arrows within a pane, Tab between panes, `Ctrl-K` for the command palette, `?` for
  the sheet that documents all of it. Everything is reachable without a pointer.
- **Continuity** — scope, article and every filter are account state, restored before the first list
  is fetched.
- **Full-text search** over SQLite FTS5, with a permanent test gating it (the extension is loadable,
  not compiled in, so a dependency bump that dropped it would otherwise silently remove search).
- **Four structural guards in CI** — no `.css` files, no application JavaScript, no SQL outside
  `internal/store`, no `syscall/js` outside `client/platform`.
- **The document set** — `plan.md` as the spec of record, `TODO.md` the dependency-ordered build,
  `FLOWS.md` the nine paths that are easy to get subtly wrong, `design/` the visual spec.
